Hidden & Dangerous 2 and Mafia .DTA Archive Extractor
=====================================================

Description
-----------

Use this program to extract the .DTA files from Hidden & Dangerous 2 and Mafia. 
PlaceDTAUnpacker.exe and tmp.dll in your Hidden & Dangerous 2, or Mafia directory.

You need to run the program from the command-line, and provide it with 3 arguments:

`DTAUnpacker.exe [DTA file] [key1] [key2]`

Like so:

`DTAunpacker.exe Sounds.dta 0x8D2965CA 0x4FE85106`

You can obtain the list of keys for specific files by simply running the program without
the 3 arguments. Note that the keys are hardcoded so they cannot be changed.

The program only works with .DTA version ISD0. H&D2:SS uses ISD1, which is a different
file format. Not all files are supported at the moment, but they will be in the future.
